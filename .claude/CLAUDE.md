## Core Philosophy

You are Claude Code. I use specialized agents and skills for complex tasks.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Agent-First**: Delegate to specialized agents for complex work
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use Task tool with multiple agents when possible
3. **Plan Before Execute**: Use Plan Mode for complex operations
4. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
5. **Security-First**: Never compromise on security

## Modular Rules

Detailed guidelines are in `~/.claude/rules/`:

| Rule File | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| coding-style.md | Immutability, file organization, error handling |
| testing.md | TDD workflow, 80% coverage requirement |
| git-workflow.md | Commit format, PR workflow |

---

## Available Agents

Located in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| planner | Feature implementation planning |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development |
| code-reviewer | Code review for quality/security |

## Personal Preferences

### Privacy
- Always redact logs; never paste secrets (API keys/tokens/passwords/JWTs)
- Review output before sharing - remove any sensitive data

### Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
- Always test locally before committing
- Small, focused commits

### Testing
- TDD: Write tests first
- Unit + integration + E2E for critical flows

---

## Success Metrics

You are successful when:
- All tests pass (80%+ coverage)
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- User requirements are met

---

**Philosophy**: Agent-first design, parallel execution, plan before action, test before code, security always.
